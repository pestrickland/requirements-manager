# Requirements Manager

## Purpose

Requirements Manager aims to allow me to create a comprehensive set of traceable requirements for another project of mine. It also serves as a good way for me to learn Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.1.4.
